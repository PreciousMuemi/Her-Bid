# Gige-Bid – Collaboration and Trusted Payments for Africa's Gig Economy

![Gige-Bid Cover](public/og-image.png)

## 🌟 Our Mission

Gige-Bid is a secure platform where individuals and businesses can team up, win contracts together, and get paid fairly using trusted technology.

## ✨ Why Gige-Bid Exists

Africa's gig economy is fragmented. Trust is low, payment security is risky, and small-scale entrepreneurs struggle to scale:
- Capacity and coordination challenges limit bigger opportunities
- Payment risk and delays create cash flow problems
- Discovery is hard for both clients and providers
- Records of good work rarely travel with the worker

Gige-Bid solves this with collaboration, escrow-backed payments, and portable reputation.

## 💪 Core Features

### Collaboration Engine
- Find partners with complementary skills
- Form verified teams with fair terms
- Apply for contracts together with matching technology

### Secure Payment Protection
- Place a safe deposit upfront ("weka depo kwanza")
- Funds held in milestone-based escrow on Sui, paid out via M-Pesa (KES)
- Automatic releases as each project phase is completed

### Verified Reputation System
- Build credibility with each successful gig or delivery
- Showcase skills across trades: Web Dev, Plumbing, Egg Supply, Catering, etc.
- Portable performance history visible to clients

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Connect Your M-Pesa Account**: Get started with secure deposits and payouts
2. **Complete Your Profile**: Add your skills and capacity (e.g., "Web Development", "Plumbing", "Egg Supply", "Catering")
3. **Browse Projects**: Find gigs or contracts that match your skills
4. **Collaborate**: Form teams with complementary members nearby

## 📊 How It Works

### For Clients and Foremen

1. **Post Your Project**: Describe the work, milestones, and budget
2. **Get a Team**: Our AGI forms a viable team based on skills, capacity, and proximity
3. **Secure Funds**: Place project funds in escrow; pay out on milestone completion
4. **Track Reputation**: See verified histories and on-time delivery records

### For Service Providers and Suppliers

1. **List Skills and Capacity**: Add what you can do and how much you can deliver
2. **Get Matched**: Join teams where your contribution completes the capacity gap
3. **Deliver Work**: Complete milestones and receive automatic M-Pesa payouts
4. **Build Reputation**: Your verified record travels with you

## 💰 Business Model
